## General Description
This repository showcases the methods to automate designing the layout of construction material stocks for reuse.

## Methods
### 1D_stock_path_design
Generating optimal designs for 1D reclaimed building materials using improved A* algorithm, heuristic algorithm, and genetic algorithm for pathfinding, stock assignment, and overall optimization structure, respectively

### reuse_design_rl
Automated layout design process of 2D stocks using Deep Reinforcement Learning
